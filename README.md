## Overview

This project is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The application leverages a machine learning model trained on a dataset of health metrics, enabling users to input their data and receive predictions about their diabetic status.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for users to input their health data and receive instant predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The prediction engine is powered by a well-trained machine learning model that has been optimized for accuracy.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can get real-time results and insights based on their inputs.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: The user inputs relevant health data, such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.
2. **Model Prediction**: The input data is processed through a trained machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes.
3. **Output**: The application displays the prediction, indicating whether the user is likely to be diabetic or not.
