<h1>Diabetes_Prediction</h1> 
<p>This model uses machine learning to predict whether a person has diabetes based on specific features (like age, glucose levels, etc.). The model is typically trained on a dataset containing these features and the corresponding labels (whether the person has diabetes or not).</p>

<h3>The general process involves:</h3>

Data Input: User provides health data through the web app.<br>
Preprocessing: The input data is preprocessed (scaled/normalized) to match the format expected by the model.<br>
Model Prediction: The trained model processes the input data and generates a prediction (e.g., "Diabetic" or "Non-Diabetic").<br>
Output: The prediction is displayed back to the user via the web interface.<br>
